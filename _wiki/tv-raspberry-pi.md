# TV Raspberry Pi

Full page OS running on a raspberry pi 2b+, configured to idea fab labs AP. Default user/pass (need to double check ssh credentials). FullPageOS is available on the rpi-installer.

## Usage

- Edit the URL that loads in Chromium on the SD card
- Control any other pages (for a presentation) using a VNC client. Still need to figure that one out.
