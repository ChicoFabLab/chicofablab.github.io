# How to Contribute

This wiki works by committing markdown files:

1. Go to the `_wiki/` folder on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" to create a new page
3. Name it something like `my-page.md`
4. Add front matter at the top:

```
---
title: My Page
---

your content here in markdown
```

5. Commit the file
6. It will appear on the homepage automatically

That's it! No login, no CMS, just commit markdown files.
