# How to Contribute

## If you're in the ChicoFabLab organization

You can directly commit markdown files:

1. Go to the `_wiki/` folder on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" to create a new page
3. Name it something like `my-page.md`
4. Add front matter at the top:

```
---
title: My Page
---

your content here in markdown
```

5. Commit the file
6. It will appear on the homepage automatically

## If you're outside the organization

You need to submit a pull request:

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to the `_wiki/` folder in your fork
3. Click "Add file" to create a new page
4. Name it something like `my-page.md`
5. Add front matter at the top:

```
---
title: My Page
---

your content here in markdown
```

6. Commit the file to your fork
7. Go back to the main repository and create a pull request
8. Once approved and merged, it will appear on the homepage

That's it! No login, no CMS, just commit markdown files (or submit a PR).
