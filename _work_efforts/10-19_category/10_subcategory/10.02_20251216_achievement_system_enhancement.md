## Objective
Transform the existing achievements system into a comprehensive gamified learning experience that tracks both site interactions and Fab Lab skill progression, with a dedicated achievements page, improved floating panel, and proper privacy controls.

## Completed Tasks
1. [x] Create dismissible privacy disclaimer component with data export/clear controls
2. [x] Expand achievement data model with Fab Lab skills, rarity tiers, and XP values

4. [x] Enhance panel UI with level display, stats, and improved achievement cards
5. [x] Create dedicated /wiki/achievements.md page with full gamification experience
6. [x] Add ~14 new Fab Lab skill-based achievements across 3D, laser, CNC paths
7. [x] Implement XP/level system with progress tracking and level-up celebrations
8. [x] Add rarity colors, holographic effects, and enhanced animations
