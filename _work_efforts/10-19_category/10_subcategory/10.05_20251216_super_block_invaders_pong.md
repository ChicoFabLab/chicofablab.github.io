## Objective
Transform the basic Pong easter egg into "Super Block Invaders Pong" - an epic mashup of Pong, Breakout, and Space Invaders with lives, powerups, space invaders, brick walls, and a comprehensive scoring system.

## Game Design Vision

### Core Concept
A hybrid arcade game where:
- Two players (you vs CPU) defend their brick walls using paddles
- Space Invaders float in the middle zone and shoot lasers at both players
- Ball bounces and destroys bricks/invaders
- Powerups drop from destroyed bricks/invaders
- Lives system - get hit by lasers = lose life
- Win by: destroying all opponent bricks OR reducing their lives to 0

### Visual Layout

## Features to Implement

### 1. Brick Walls (Breakout-style)
- [ ] 4x5 grid of bricks on each side protecting the goals
- [ ] Different brick types: normal (1 hit), strong (2 hits), indestructible
- [ ] Bricks have colors based on strength
- [ ] Brick destruction triggers particle effects

### 2. Space Invaders
- [ ] 2-3 rows of invaders floating in the middle
- [ ] Invaders move in classic formation (left-right, descend)
- [ ] Random shooting (lasers go toward both players)
- [ ] Invaders respawn in waves with increasing difficulty
- [ ] Different invader types with different behaviors

### 3. Lives System
- [ ] Player starts with 3 lives
- [ ] CPU has 3 lives
- [ ] Lose life when: hit by invader laser, ball passes your paddle
- [ ] Game over when lives = 0
- [ ] Lives displayed as hearts

### 4. Powerups
Dropped randomly when destroying bricks/invaders:
- [ ] ❤️ Extra Life - +1 life
- [ ] 📏 Paddle Extend - Larger paddle for 15s
- [ ] 🛡️ Shield - Block next laser hit
- [ ] 🔫 Laser Gun - Shoot lasers with spacebar for 10s
- [ ] ⚡ Speed Ball - Ball goes faster
- [ ] 🌟 Multi-Ball - Split into 3 balls
- [ ] 🧲 Magnet - Ball sticks to paddle once
- [ ] 🔥 Fire Ball - Ball passes through bricks for 5s

### 5. Scoring System
- Destroy brick: +100 points
- Destroy strong brick: +200 points
- Destroy invader: +150 points
- Destroy elite invader: +300 points
- Collect powerup: +50 points
- Win round: +1000 points
- Combo multiplier for rapid hits

### 6. Wave System
- [ ] Wave 1: Basic invaders, normal bricks
- [ ] Wave 2: More invaders, faster shooting
- [ ] Wave 3+: Elite invaders, strong bricks
- [ ] Boss wave every 5 waves (giant invader)
- [ ] Difficulty scales with wave number

### 7. Enhanced Leaderboard
- [ ] Track total score (not just wins)
- [ ] Track waves survived
- [ ] Track invaders destroyed
- [ ] Track highest combo

### 8. Visual Polish
- [ ] Starfield background
- [ ] Particle effects on destruction
- [ ] Screen shake on hits
- [ ] Glow effects on powerups
- [ ] Retro scanline effect (optional)

### 9. Sound Integration
- [ ] Different sounds for brick types
- [ ] Invader movement sounds
- [ ] Powerup collection sound
- [ ] Boss music (if applicable)

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `_wiki/pong.mkd` → Complete rewrite

### Code Structure
```javascript
// Game entities
- Player { paddle, lives, score, powerups }
- CPU { paddle, lives }
- Ball[] { position, velocity, effects }
- Brick[][] { type, health, position }
- Invader[][] { type, health, position, shootTimer }
- Powerup[] { type, position, velocity }
- Laser[] { owner, position, velocity }

// Game state
- currentWave
- gamePhase (playing, waveComplete, gameOver, victory)
- comboMultiplier, comboTimer
```
