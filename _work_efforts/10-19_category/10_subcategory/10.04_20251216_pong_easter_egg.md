## Objective
Add a fully playable Pong game as an easter egg to the CFL site, accessible via a hidden button in the footer, with a 3-initial leaderboard.

## Tasks
1. [x] Create `_wiki/pong.mkd` with complete Pong game
2. [x] Add hidden easter egg button in footer
3. [x] Add 'pong-master' achievement to achievements system
4. [x] Add CSS for footer easter egg styling
5. [x] Update `docs/EASTER-EGGS.md` with Pong documentation

## Implementation Details

### Files Created
- `_wiki/pong.mkd` - Complete Pong game page with:
  - Vanilla Canvas API implementation (~300 lines)
  - Player vs CPU gameplay
  - First to 5 wins
  - Keyboard controls (W/S, Arrow keys, Space, P, R)
  - 3-initial leaderboard (localStorage)
  - Win/lose modals
  - Integration with CFL.sounds, CFL.toast, CFL.achievements

### Files Modified
- `_layouts/default.html`:
  - Added `pong-master` achievement to achievements system
  - Added hidden `.footer-easter-egg` link in footer
- `assets/css/main.css`:
  - Added `.footer-easter-egg` styles (subtle dot, hover reveals)
- `docs/EASTER-EGGS.md`:
  - Added Pong game documentation section
  - Updated achievement table

### Technical Decisions
- **Vanilla Canvas over library**: Chosen for makerspace ethos (DIY, educational, maintainable)
- **localStorage leaderboard**: Simple, no external dependencies, privacy-friendly
- **Hidden in footer**: Subtle easter egg that rewards exploration

## Progress
- Created complete, working Pong game
- Integrated with site's sound system, toast notifications, and achievements
- Added hidden footer access point
- Documented in easter eggs documentation

## Next Steps
1. Test gameplay across browsers
2. Consider adding mobile touch controls in future
3. Potential expansion: arcade section with more games

## Notes
- Game difficulty is balanced for casual play (CPU has slight delay)
- Ball speed increases each volley for tension
- Unlocks "Pong Champion" achievement on first win
- Visiting the page unlocks "Egg Hunter" achievement
